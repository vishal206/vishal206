# Hi, I'm Vishal ðŸ‘‹ :man_technologist:

<img src="https://github.com/vishal206/vishal206/blob/main/vishalbanner.png" >

I'm pursuing B. Tech specializing in Computer Science and Engineering.  And I have also been active in VIT's clubs and chapters as a board member of VIT animation club and a core member of the Mozilla firefox club. Apart from VIT, I'm a core member of a growing community named OpInCo and a design executive in HackThe6ix. And through this experience, I have been able to learn skills like attention to detail, multi-tasking, and communicating with a team. Along with my degree, I learned android application development which helped me participate and win in hackathons, and land an internship at a start-up named Vite-fintech. This is where I started to refine my skills as a developer.
